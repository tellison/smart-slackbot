# action: log

# EnforceDefault : enforce policy on default branch.
# Overrides the same setting at org-level.
#
# enforceDefault: true

# EnforceBranches : set of non-default branches to enforce policy on.

# allowed irrespective of DisableRepoOverride setting.
#
# enforceBranches: [ master, main ]

# RequireApproval : enforce approval of PRs.
# Overrides the same setting at org-level.
#
# requireApproval: true

# RequireCodeOwnerReviews : enforce code owner reviews on PRs.

# same setting at org-level.
#
# requireCodeOwnerReviews: false
  
# ApprovalCount : the number of required PR approvals.
# Overrides the same setting at org-level.
#
